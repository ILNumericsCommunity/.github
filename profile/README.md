## ILNumerics Community

The [ILNumericsÂ®](https://ilnumerics.net/) community on GitHub is dedicated to enriching and expanding the ILNumerics ecosystem. ILNumerics has successfully enabled engineers and scientists across various industries, such as finance and automotive, to effectively develop, deploy, and maintain complex technical applications.

ILNumerics offers two primary products:

1. **Computing Engine**: Brings efficiency to numerical array codes within .NET. Its array-based mathematical language is fully compatible with Matlab and numpy. Its algorithms can run on any architecture supporting .NET, and its execution speed surpasses that of FORTRAN and other numerical languages.

2. **Data Visualization Engine**: Offers advanced 2D and 3D visualizations for .NET applications developed in C# and Visual Basic. Users can create production-ready plots and graphs using provided templates or customize their visualizations according to specific requirements. The engine supports an extensive range of plotting options, with both high-level and low-level 2D and 3D visualization objects available.

The community aims to foster a collaborative, open-source environment where participants can create, share, and improve tools and libraries that extend the capabilities of ILNumerics. Whether you're an experienced user, a developer, or new to the ILNumerics platform, this community provides an opportunity to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to the growth and utility of the ILNumerics framework.
